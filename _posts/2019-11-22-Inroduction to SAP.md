Data is maintained at a central location (Means one database for every module) and a department can access data of other departments OR we can say that each department/module is connected with a common database. 
It increases productivity. Better customer interaction and also internal interaction. 

## Introduction to SAP  
 
SAP stands for System Application & Products in Data processing. SAP is also an ERP used by thousands of customers. The business functions within SAP ERPâ€™s software are called modules.

    R = Real time 
    2 = Two tier architecture

## SAP R/3 Architecture Model 
 
SAP R/3 has three layers as below. 

### Presentation layer: UI 
The presentation layer consists of the user interface (UI), which runs on a client machine that uses a standard graphical user interface (GUI). The UI can be a web browser or propriety software, such as SAP GUI. 
 
### Application layer: 
The application layer is where all the major work is done by ABAP programs. 
 
### Database Layer: 
The database layer is where all the persistent data is stored. The database is typically managed by a relational database management system (RDBMS).
