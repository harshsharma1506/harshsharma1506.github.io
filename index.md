## 🤷 What I do

Currently, I’m immersed in the world of ABAP, where I collaborate closely with the Business Intelligence (BI), Sales and Distribution (SD), GRC and Financial Accounting & Controlling (FICO) modules. My role involves developing custom solutions and enhancing existing functionalities to streamline processes and improve data accessibility for users.

Looking ahead, I’m excited to expand my skill set by diving into JavaScript and SAPUI5. I believe that these technologies will not only enhance my development capabilities but also enable me to create more interactive and user-friendly applications. I’m eager to explore how I can leverage them to deliver even greater value in my projects.

## 🦕 What I've done before

Before diving into ABAP, I had a blast as a Python developer, crafting dynamic web applications using Django and working extensively with SQL. Those experiences not only honed my coding skills but also ignited my passion for building innovative solutions that address real-world problems.
