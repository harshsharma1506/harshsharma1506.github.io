## Harry's Garden 🌱

Since a long time I wanted to have a site for myself, I am a backend develepor and have hardly worked on any good UI tech. 
So, here I am, betting on the static website powered by Jekyll. You can copy this as well and customize this website as your own 😸. 

### Structure of the website as of now 

As of now, we only have the home page where I have one section dedicated to what I am doing right now 
then, on what I used to do ( this part, well, let's say we all contain our past within the present, hence, it is quite short. 
After that we have one side projects section which is kinda fun to have, as a rule of my own thumb, I have added 4 projects here 😎

After that we have this `Blogs` section where you can find the blog posts so in Jekyll sites, we can have blog posts as markdown files
if you use this template, you can use the `_posts` folder to add your blog posts, the naming convention is sort of like this 
`yyyy-mm-dd-<title>.md` here, the fun fact is if your date is in the future then the post will appear on the site at that time only 😉

And then in the `_head.html` after the loop of the template engine I have added one Resume link as download which is actually using a CDN to access the file. 

### How to re use this repo
Fork it and then go to the settings of the repo and make it as a template , make another repo by clicking on `use this template`
Name the repo as - <github_user_name>.github.io and you are all set 🏂. You can contact me or open issues in case something doesn't work. Always happy to help. 
You can also fork the original template that I had forked and used - https://github.com/katmh/point-theme
